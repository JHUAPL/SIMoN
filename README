##  Setup
* clone the repository
	* `git clone https://github.com/circuitinstitute/simon.git`
* install Docker
	* https://docs.docker.com/install/
* install Docker Compose
	* https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
* install Make

## Usage
1.  choose the models that you want to run together in the SIMoN framework
2.  add your chosen models to the "models" list in `broker/config.json`
3.  add your chosen models to the "services" in `build/docker-compose.yml`
4.  start SIMoN
	* `make all`
5.  shut down SIMoN
	* `make down` to stop all models
	* `make clean` to stop all models and clear the database

## Add a new model
1. create a new directory with 3 required subdirectories, based on `models/template/`
    * `src/` stores the model's unique source code
        * `inner_wrapper.py`
            * required file
            * must implement `configure()` and `increment()` methods
            * must specify the model's ID (unique name)
        * any aditional code that the model needs
    * `schemas/` stores JSON schemas that data messages must validate against
        * `input/` schemas that incoming data messages must validate against
            * `*.json`
        * `output/` schemas that ougoing data messages must validate against
            * `*.json`
    * `config/` stores JSON objects with parameters needed for the model's initialization
        * `*.json`
2. add the new model to the "models" list in `broker/config.json`
3. add the new model to the "services" in `build/docker-compose.yml`
